# Virtual-Angle-Mesurment
This small code is able to measure the angle between the lines/surface edge.

First, do some prerequisite work. Here we are using 2 Modules of python.
1. OpenCV
2. Math
3. Enthusiasm for learning (ðŸ˜…Just kidding Above 2 are sufficient)

You can pip them with just two lines below.
```
pip install opencv-python
pip install python-math
```
You can use this for your reference.
